**ChatGPT is the coding agent. DevSpace is the local runtime and tool layer.**

DevSpace is a self-hosted MCP server that lets ChatGPT and other MCP hosts directly work with local projects through workspace-scoped filesystem tools, native shell execution, persistent process sessions, Git worktrees, artifacts, and change review. DevSpace does not invoke another coding model or coding-agent provider behind the scenes.

## Installation

DevSpace requires Node `>=22.19 <27`.

Install the DevSpace CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @waishnav/devspace
```

Then initialize and start the server:

```bash
devspace init
devspace serve
```

Or run it without a global install:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace init
npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

During setup, DevSpace asks for:

- the local project folders ChatGPT is allowed to open through DevSpace
- the local port, usually `7676`
- your public HTTPS base URL from Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, Pinggy, Tailscale Funnel, or
  another reverse proxy

Use the public origin without `/mcp` during setup:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com
```

You will configure your MCP client with the public `/mcp` URL after setup.

When the client connects, DevSpace opens an Owner password approval page. Enter
the Owner password printed by `devspace init`. It is also stored in:

```text
~/.devspace/auth.json
```

Keep that password private.

## Connect Your MCP Client

The default local endpoint is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7676/mcp
```

Most users should connect through a public HTTPS tunnel:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com/mcp
```

> [!NOTE]
> Using DevSpace as an MCP connector isn't against OpenAI's Usage Policies — it's
> a standard custom App/connector setup, and writing or running code isn't a
> restricted use case. But your account is governed by your usage, not by
> DevSpace. Don't point it at anything that would violate your provider's terms.
> Used normally, you're fine. (Based on OpenAI's Usage Policies and Service Terms
> as of June 2026.)

## What ChatGPT Can Do

Once connected, ChatGPT can open one of your approved project folders as a
workspace. From there, it can inspect the repo, make scoped edits, run commands,
and show you what changed.

DevSpace gives ChatGPT tools to:

- read and search files inside the opened workspace
- apply structured patches for precise source changes
- run normal local development commands, including file operations, Git, package managers, generators, tests, builds, and project scripts
- keep long-running and interactive processes available through persistent process sessions
- use isolated Git worktrees for parallel coding sessions
- follow project instructions from `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
- discover local agent skills from your skill folders
- show tool cards and optional change summaries in ChatGPT Apps-compatible hosts

## Mental Model

The MCP host is the coding agent. DevSpace is remote access to selected local folders and the local development runtime.

You decide which roots are allowed for structured filesystem tools. Shell commands run with the authority of the local user running DevSpace and are not an OS sandbox. Treat a connected client like a trusted coding partner with access to your machine.

For a normal ChatGPT coding session:

1. Start your tunnel.
2. Run `devspace serve`.
3. Connect the MCP client to your public `/mcp` URL.
4. Approve the connection with the Owner password.
5. Ask ChatGPT to open a project inside one of your allowed roots.

## Platform Support

DevSpace supports Linux, macOS, and Windows environments with a Bash-compatible
shell.

| Platform                                          | Status            | Notes                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Linux                                             | Supported         | Requires Node, npm, Git, and Bash.             |
| macOS                                             | Supported         | Requires Node, npm, Git, and Bash.             |
| Windows with Git Bash, WSL, MSYS2, or Cygwin Bash | Supported         | Git Bash is the simplest native Windows setup. |
| Windows PowerShell or `cmd.exe` only              | Not supported yet | Install Git Bash or use WSL.                   |

Run this to inspect your local setup:

```bash
devspace doctor
```

## Philosophy

Every piece of software is becoming conversational. Natural language is
redefining how we interact with tools, workflows, and systems.

DevSpace keeps that relationship direct: MCP-capable hosts such as ChatGPT and Claude perform the reasoning and coding work themselves, while DevSpace provides explicit, inspectable access to the local development environment.

## Built by Waishnav

I'm Waishnav. I like building opinionated products and tools, and Artifacts is one example.

This year, I began my journey to build a one-person, multi-agent company capable of generating millions in revenue. If you want to follow the failures, wins, lessons, and everything in between, come hang out with me on [X](https://x.com/wshxnv).
